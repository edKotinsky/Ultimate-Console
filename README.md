<p>This is the README of my first-test-hobby project Ultimate Console. 
It's intended to provide simple command-line interface to programs.
This interface consists of commands, options, keys (same options
with short one character names), arguments and variable.</p>

The syntax is:

    command [ --option [ = value ] ] [ -key [ value ] ] [ arguments ]
    variable = value

<p>Each string must be end up with EOL, EOF or ';'. </p>

<p>I'm too lazy to write full README, so this is all.
And I know my English is bad. So what?</p>
